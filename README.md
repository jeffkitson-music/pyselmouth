# :snake: pyselmouth
A GUI wrapper for [pyseltongue](https://github.com/ginsburgnm/pyseltongue) using [appJar](https://github.com/jarvisteach/appJar).

## :closed_lock_with_key: About
This is a simple GUI wrapper for pyseltongue, an implmentation of the [Shamir Secret Sharing algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing). 
Essentially the SSS is a way to mathematically break a secret into pieces (called shares or shards) to be distributed to different people/entities. The secret can only be revealed when a majority (e.g. 3 of 5) of the shares are combined.

Primary uses:
- Lorem
- Ipsum
- Lorem Ipsum
- LOREM IPSUM

## :books: Requirements
- pyseltongue (pip install pyseltonge)
- appJar (pip install appjar)
